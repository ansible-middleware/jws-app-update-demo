# Ansible JWS demo

This playbook demonstrate how to install and upgrade Apache Tomcat (or JBoss Web Server) and also deploy and update a webapp using Ansible.

## Requirements

This demo has been tested on a RHEL 8.4 system using Ansible 2.9.22 (as provided by Red Hat) running wit Python3.

### Red Hat RPM repository to enable

The system needs registered into RHN, with subscription for both Ansible and JWS attached. The following repos having enabled:

    # subscription-manager repos --enable ansible-2.9-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms

The provided role for JWS as also a dependency that needs to be install after Ansible has been successfully installed. First,
checkout the middleware_automation.jws project and build the collection:

    $ git clone https://github.com/web-servers/jws-ansible-playbook.git ./jws.git
    $ cd jws.git
    $ ansible-galaxy collection build .

Once the collection has been properly created, you can install it using ansible-galaxy (not that it will download the required dependency):

    $ ansible-galaxy install middleware_automation-jws-0.0.1.tar.gz
    Process install dependency map
    Starting collection install process
    Installing 'middleware_automation.jws:0.0.1' to '/root/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/middleware_automation/jws'
    Installing 'middleware_automation.redhat_csp_download:1.1.1' to '/root/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/middleware_automation/redhat_csp_download

## Run the demo

Add your RHN creds into a YAML file:

    rhn_username: xxxx@redhat.com
    rhn_password: 'PASSWORD!'

Then run Ansible to install JWS and the demo app:

    $ ansible-playbook -e @rhn_creds.yml -e @version_1.0.yml playbook.yml

To update the application, run again Ansible:

    $ ansible-playbook -e @rhn_creds.yml -e @version_1.1.yml  playbook.yml
